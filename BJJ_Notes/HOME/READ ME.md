Hello and welcome to my Jiujitsu note project!
I think before diving into all the moves and looking at the small details, its important to keep in mind that when it comes to most things in life, not just BJJ, there isn't a 100% right way to do something, most of the time it depends...

Additionally I'm only a blue belt currently, so the gif's i record probably won't have perfect technique, but I think it'll be good enough to get an idea, and if you see a detail i could use, i will try to implement it and record the move again when i have time.
So with that out of the way, i look forward to reading your commits!

Feel free to change [[Current Focus]] in your local copy to whatever you're currently working on!

Also if you want to contribute here's some default key binds for obsidian that are pretty useful!
